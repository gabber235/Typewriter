## Quest Setup
This guide is split up into 2 sections. 
- [**Manifest Section**](#manifest-section): Covers how to set the quest up and add the objective.
- [**Sequence Section**](#sequence-section): Explains how to make the npc give the quest and how to make the objective completable.

</Section>
</SplitLayout>

## Manifest Section
:::warning[Before Starting]
Make sure you have the [Entity Extension](../04-entity-extension/index.mdx) guide completed before starting this tutorial.
> In this guide we will be using the Oliver NPC as the quest giver.

Also make sure you have created a manifest page.
:::
> In this section, we will be setting up the quest and adding the objective to the manifest.
### Creating the Quest
Now inside the manifest page, click on the **+** button in the top right corner and search for `Quest`. Click on the **+** button to add it to your page.

<EntrySearch entryName="quest" />

#### Configuring the Quest Entry
Now inside the quest entry set the following fields:
* **Display Name**: `ZombieQuest`
* **Active Criteria**: `Zombie Quest Fact >= 1`
* **Completed Criteria**: `Zombie Quest Fact = 2`\
*For this guide I used a permanent fact*

### Adding the Objective
Now inside the quest entry, click on the **+** button in the top right corner and search for `Completable Objective`. Click on the **+** button to add it to your page.

<EntrySearch entryName="completable_objective" />

### Configuring the Objective Entry
Now inside the objective entry set the following fields:
* **Quest**: `ZombieQuest`
* **Show Criteria**: `Zombie Quest Fact = 1`
* **Completed Criteria**: `Zombie Quest Fact = 1` + `Killed Zombies Fact >= 2`
* **Display**: `Kill 2 Zombies`
:::tip[Optional]
Inside the display you can also choose the display the progress using [PlaceHolderAPI](../../05-helpful-features/03-placeholderapi.mdx)

*Example:* `Kill 2 zombies (%typewriter_nOfQzADcAmcR6ao%/2)`

> We will be using this in the final result!
:::
:::tip[Optional #2]
You can also add a second objective that requires the player to return to the NPC.

* **Show Criteria**: `Zombie Quest Fact = 1` + `Kill Zombie Fact >= 2`
* **Completed Criteria**: `Zombie Quest Fact = 2`
* **Display**: `Return to Oliver`

See [talk objective](./01-talk-objective.mdx) for more information on how to do this.

### Manifest Result
<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("../../assets/questing/kill-zombie-objective/manifest.json"),
    require("../../assets/questing/kill-zombie-objective/static.json")
]} />

## Sequence Section
:::info[Before Starting]
It is recommended to have a good understanding of [Interactions](../01-interactions/index.mdx) and [Facts](../03-facts/index.mdx) before starting this section.
:::
> In this section, we will be creating the sequence that gives the player the quest and makes the objective completable.

### Interaction with Oliver
Now we need to create the interaction with Oliver. This is where the player will receive the quest.
Click on the **+** button in the top right corner and search for `Add Entity Interact Event`. Click on the **+** button to add it to your page.

<EntrySearch entryName="entity_interact_event" />

Inside the entry set the Definition field to `Oliver` (or what you named your npc).

### Adding dialogue to Oliver
Now when you click on Oliver nothing happens. It would be nice to add some dialogue to the npc.
> The following steps are optional, but recommended to make the quest more immersive.
1. Add a `New Option` to your sequence and set the following fields:
   * **Text**: `Could you help me with something?`
   * **Option 1**: `Yeah sure, whats up?`
   * **Option 2**: `No sorry.`
2. Now in the option 1 add a trigger for a spoken with fields:
   * **Text**: `Go kill 2 zombies.`
   * **Duration**: `1s`

### Triggering the quest
Now we need to trigger the quest when the player clicks on the first option.
Right click on the `New Spoken` (or what you used) and select `Link with ...` select the `Triggers | 1` and search for `Add Track Quest`.

<EntrySearch entryName="track_quest" />

Inside the entry set the quest field to `Kill Zombie Quest` and add a modifier: `Zombie Quest Fact = 1`.

### On kill increase fact
Now we need to increase the fact when the player kills a zombie. To do this we need to add a `On Player Kill Entity` event to the sequence.

<EntrySearch entryName="on_player_kill_entity" />

Inside the entry enable the Enity Type and set the Entity Type to `Zombie`.

### Increasing the fact
Now we need to increase the fact when the player kills a zombie. To do this right click on the `On Player Kill Entity` and select `Link with ...` select the `Triggers | 1` and search for `Add Simple Action`.

<EntrySearch entryName="simple_action" />

Inside the entry set the following fields:
* **Criteria**: `Zombie Quest Fact = 1`
* **modifier**: `Zombies Killed Fact + 1`  

This will increase the fact by 1 every time the player kills a zombie and only do this if the player has the quest.

### Sequence Result
<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("../../assets/questing/kill-zombie-objective/sequence.json"),
    require("../../assets/questing/kill-zombie-objective/manifest.json"),
    require("../../assets/questing/kill-zombie-objective/static.json")
]} />

## Final Result
Now when you click on Oliver you will get the dialogue and when you click on the first option you will get the quest. When you kill 2 zombies the objective will be completed.
