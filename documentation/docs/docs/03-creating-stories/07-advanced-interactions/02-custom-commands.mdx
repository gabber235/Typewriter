# Custom Commands
:::info[Before starting]
This guide assumes that you have already installed the [Basic Extension](../../02-getting-started/01-installation.mdx#basic-extension).
:::

In this tutorial, you will learn about custom commands and how to create one. We will create a command where you can define a pseudo and an age to display a message to the player.

## Creating a Custom Command
In this tutorial, we will create a command where you can define a pseudo and an age to display a message to the player. We will use a Custom Command Entry to start defining our command.
To add a custom command entry, go to the top right corner of the panel and click on the + icon. Search for `Add Custom Command`, add it to your manifest and name it.
<EntrySearch entryName="custom_command" />

## Creating the arguments
Now, we will need two types of arguments; a `Word Argument` to get a word, in this case, the pseudo, and a `Number Argument` to get a number, in this case, the age.
To add an argument, click on the `Custom Command` entry, then on `Arguments`, and select `Add Word Argument`. Next, click on the last argument and add a child: `Add Number Argument`.

:::tip[Number Argument]
Rename your arguments to make it easier for players to understand it when they will execute the command.
:::

## Do something with your command
Then, if you want your command to perform an action, add a Trigger to the last argument. So, in the `Number Argument`, click on `Trigger` and choose your action entry. In this case, we will use a `Send Message` entry.
To retrieve what the player has entered in the arguments, we will use a `Interaction Context Text Variable` and add keys to it. Finally, we need to construct a message using the values retrieved from the arguments.

## Result

### Sequence result
Now your pages should look something like this:
<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("./assets/commands/sequence.json"),
    require("./assets/commands/manifest.json"),
]} />
:::warning[Variables]
Our documentation renderer doesn't currently support displaying dynamic variables, so you'll only see a simplified static message instead of the actual variable.
:::

### In Game result
In game, the command should look like this:
<Player url={require("../../assets/custom-commands/result.webm").default} />
