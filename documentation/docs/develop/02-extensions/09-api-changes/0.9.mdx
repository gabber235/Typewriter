# 0.9.X API changes

## `ThreadType` Deprecation

Originally, `ThreadType` was used to invoke the coroutine context for different processes in Typewriter.
This is now deprecated in favor of actual coroutines dispatchers and contexts.

### Primary Bukkit Thread
This operates on the Paper main thread and should be used for all Paper API interactions.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
ThreadType.SYNC.launch {}
// highlight-green
Dispatchers.Sync.launch {}
```

### Async Bukkit Thread
This executes on the asynchronous Paper thread, suitable for tasks without strict timing requirements or those intended for the Paper scheduler.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
ThreadType.ASYNC.launch {}
// highlight-green
Dispatchers.TickedAsync.launch {}
```

### Async Typewriter Thread Pool
Utilize the Typewriter thread pool for time-sensitive tasks.
As the most asynchronous of the three dispatchers and independent of the paper scheduler, it continues operating even during scheduler lag.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
// highlight-red
ThreadType.DISPATCHERS_ASYNC.launch {}
// highlight-green
Dispatchers.UntickedAsync.launch {}
```

If working in **IntelliJ**, it will automatically suggest the correct replacements.
