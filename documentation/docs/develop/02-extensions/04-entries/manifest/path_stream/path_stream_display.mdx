# PathStreamDisplay

`PathStreamDisplayEntry` enables the rendering of custom path streams to players.
A new display is generated for each viewer whenever a stream is recalculated, which occurs at the interval defined by `refreshDuration`.

## When to Use It

Create a `PathStreamDisplayEntry` when you want to customize the path stream visualization.

## Basic Structure

A `PathStreamDisplayEntry` must expose these two functions:

- `createProducer()` → `PathStreamProducer`
- `createDisplay()` → `PathStreamDisplay`

A `PathStreamProducer` is responsible for calculating the path to be displayed and tracking which paths are being displayed.
Customize this if you want to modify the path stream's positioning.

A `PathStreamDisplay` is responsible for rendering the path to the player, receiving a position every tick and displaying it appropriately.

The entry constructs a `PathStreamProducer` that computes the route and returns a `PathStream`.
Each `PathStreamDisplay` created for a viewer consumes that stream and renders its positions.
In practice, you primarily override the methods that create the producer and display.

```
PathStreamDisplayEntry
   ├─ createDisplay() ──> PathStreamDisplay
   └─ createProducer() ─> PathStreamProducer
                            └─manages─multiple─> PathStream
                                                  └─forwards─the─position─> PathStreamDisplay
```

<CodeSnippet tag="custom_path_stream_display" json={require("../../../../snippets.json")} />

The example above uses `LinePathStreamProducer`, which moves from block to block towards the end position, displaying each step once. It's the simplest producer to begin with.

## Custom Producers

Implement your own `PathStreamProducer` when you require greater control over the path stream's positioning.
