# Path Streams

`PathStream` visuals guide players to important places in the world. A `PathStreamProducer` calculates the route and feeds positions to one or more `PathStreamDisplay` implementations that render it for each viewer.

## Display Helpers

When you want to highlight a single destination or a list of locations inside an `AudienceEntry`, two helpers manage the lifecycle for you:

- `SinglePathStreamDisplay` – manages a single `PathStreamProducer` for each player.
- `MultiPathStreamDisplay` – manages multiple producers identified by an id.
