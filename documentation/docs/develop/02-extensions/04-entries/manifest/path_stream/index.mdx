# Path Streams

`PathStreams` visually guide players to important locations within the game world.
If you have key (dynamic) locations you want players to easily find, you can integrate with the `PathStream` system.

## Setting up a PathStream

There are two methods for setting up a `PathStream`, depending on the number of target positions you need to display.

### Single PathStream

If you only have a single (dynamic) target position, use the `SinglePathStream` component.

<CodeSnippet tag="single_path_stream_display" json={require("../../../../snippets.json")} />

### Multi PathStream

For multiple (dynamic) target positions, use the `MultiPathStream` component.

<CodeSnippet tag="multi_path_stream_display" json={require("../../../../snippets.json")} />

:::warning
The `MultiPathStream` component's callback function is invoked every tick to determine if the targets should still be displayed.
**Ensure this call is efficient!** Pre-calculate as much information as possible using `lazy` properties.
