# DialogueEntry

The `DialogueEntry` is used to define a type of dialogue. When a `DialogueEntry` is triggered it's associated `DialogueMessenger` will be used to display the dialogue to the player.
Multiple `DialogueMessenger`'s can be associated with a single `DialogueEntry` and the `DialogueMessenger` that is used is determined by the `DialogueMessenger`'s `MessengerFilter`.

:::info
There can always be at most one `DialogueEntry` active for a player. 
This is automatically handled by Typewriter.

## Usage
<CodeSnippet tag="dialogue_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

To define the messenger that will be used to display the dialogue to the player, you must create a class that implements the `DialogueMessenger` interface.
<CodeSnippet tag="dialogue_messenger" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

### Lifecycle
The `state` of the messenger determines what happens to the messenger. 
- `MessengerState.FINISHED` - The dialogue is finished and the next dialogue in the chain will be triggered.
- `MessengerState.CANCELLED` - The dialogue is cancelled and dialogue chain is stopped, even if there are more dialogues in the chain.
- `MessengerState.RUNNING` - The dialogue is still running and will continue to run until the state is changed.

The state object can be changed inside the `tick` method or from outside. It can even be changed from the plugin itself. For example when the user runs a command the dialogue will be cancelled.

### Confirmation Key
Some dialogue messengers may wait for the player to press a key before continuing. This key is configured globally in the plugin's `config.yml` under `confirmationKey`.
Available values are `JUMP`, `SWAP_HANDS`, and `SNEAK`. Use the `<confirmation_key>` tag in your messages to display the correct keybind to the player.

Here is a minimal example of a dialogue that waits for the configured confirmation key before moving on.
<CodeSnippet tag="dialogue_confirmation_messenger" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

There are some additional lifecycle methods that can be overridden.
- `init` - Called when the messenger is initialized. Will be called before the first `tick` call.
- `dispose` - Called when the messenger is disposed. By default this will unregister any listeners that were registered by the messenger.
- `end` - Normally this does not need to be overwritten. Only if you do not want to resend the chat history for some reason.
